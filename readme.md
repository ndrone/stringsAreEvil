# Strings Are Evil (Java)

After reading Indy Singh blog on StringsAreEvil. I wanted to investigate Java. To
see if it had the same challenges. This also gave me a chance to work with Junit 5
as well as working with Java's profiler tools even further. In Indy blog using
c# it seems that have a profiling tool accessable from the CLI. From what I can see 
currently Java doesn't have anything. It would be great to be able to profile from a test
case to see a controlled environment CPU, Memory, usages.
